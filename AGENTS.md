# AGENTS.md

**Load the `deepspace` skill before working in this repo.** It is the source
of truth for the SDK; read project source afterward for repo-specific details.

The scaffold installs the portable skill at
`.agents/skills/deepspace/SKILL.md`. Restart the agent session to load newly
installed skills, or read that file directly. If it is missing, scaffold-time
installation failed (typically a network issue); reinstall:

```sh
npx -y skills@latest add deepdotspace/deepspace-skill -y                 # this project
npx -y skills@latest add deepdotspace/deepspace-skill -g -y              # globally, every project
npx -y skills@latest add deepdotspace/deepspace-skill --agent codex -y   # specific agent
```

If installation is unavailable, read
<https://github.com/deepdotspace/deepspace-skill/blob/main/skills/deepspace/SKILL.md>.

## About this project

This is a **DeepSpace** app — a real-time collaborative app built on the
[`deepspace`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepspace) SDK and deployed to
Cloudflare Workers via `npx deepspace deploy`. It was scaffolded from the
**copilot template**: a three-panel shell (collapsible sidebar, main panel,
AI chat dock) — the shell is the app's layout and stays; the skill
(`.agents/skills/deepspace/SKILL.md`) carries its layout and AI-chat rules.

## Project commands

```sh
npx deepspace auth login   # authenticate with app.space
npx deepspace dev start    # local dev server (vite + miniflare)
npx deepspace deploy       # deploy to <app>.app.space
npx deepspace push         # publish committed code to the app's cloud repo
npx deepspace agent tools <app> --json # discover tools and their input schemas
npx deepspace agent invoke <app> <tool> --input-file tool-input.json --json
npx deepspace add --list   # list optional features (messaging, etc.)
npx deepspace add <feature>
```

For local app tools, always run `agent tools` first and follow the returned
description and input schema rather than guessing arguments. `agent invoke`
reuses the current CLI login and requires no separate connection. If it reports
`not_authenticated`, run the refusal's action when present. In a headless shell
without an action, run `npx deepspace auth login --help` and use the
operator-supplied credential path it names; never invent credentials or put a
password on the command line.

Use the DeepSpace cloud repo as the default version control; no external Git
host is required. Start parallel work with
`npx deepspace workspace new -t "<task>"`, commit normally, then run
`npx deepspace workspace sync` and `npx deepspace workspace land`. The `space`
Git remote is installed by the first DeepSpace push/pull/deploy command. With
that default DeepSpace source, deploy requires a clean commit. When the app
ships from GitHub (latched from the checkout's remote at the app's first
release, permanently), deploy instead ships the current checkout, including
dirty or unpushed bytes, and records no commit lineage for that release;
use ordinary Git to decide what should be committed and pushed.
